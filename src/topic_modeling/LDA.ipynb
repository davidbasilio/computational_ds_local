's illegal broker sell bond face value , broker sell bond price 's much higher going rate.the good news financial industry regulatory authority ( finra ) regulates bond market transaction price become available investor point . however , information n't always date could be.none reason buy corporate bond . however , 's something , investor , aware . also speaks importance working broker trust.another thing keep mind buy corporate bond individually , form share bond fund . former , choose company buy bond issued . latter , buy fund invests corporate bond , thereby getting benefit instant diversification . remember , buy bond single company fails meet financial obligation bond ( 'll get bit ) , stand lose money . buy bond fund one issuer run money problem , bulk investment remain unaffected.how make money corporate bondsfor part , two way make money investing corporate bond . first hold bond mature , collect interest payment along way . second sell bond price 's higher bought for.going back example , say buy 10-year , $ 20,000 bond paying % interest face value , $ 20,000 . first scenario , 'd hold bond year , collect % interest year , get $ 20,000 back decade . second scenario , might opportunity sell bond $ 22,000 , thereby banking difference.as noted earlier , exception formula . buy zero coupon bond , example , profit paying le face value bond getting full face value mature . similarly , buy share bond fund go value , sell share price 's higher paid , profit way.corporate bond versus bond corporate bond n't type bond . another popular investment choice municipal bond , issued city , state , locality . municipal bond work like corporate bond , one key difference : tax treatment interest payment collect . receive corporate bond interest , 's considered taxable income . collect municipal bond interest , 's always tax-exempt federal level , buy bond issued home state , interest payment free state local tax well . said , corporate bond tend offer higher interest rate municipal bond , , many case , compensate tax exemption.there also treasury bond , bond issued u.s. government . also known t-bonds , treasury bond maturity year longer , 're backed credit u.s. government , 're considered virtually risk-free . t-bond interest also tax-free state local level , though 'll pay federal tax interest collect . case municipal bond , treasury bond tend offer lower interest rate corporate bonds.corporate bond versus stocksit 's easy lump stock bond category . , goal investing either one make money . reality , two different beast . buy corporate bond , 're making loan company exchange interest payment financial incentive . however , receive upside company performs exceptionally well.when buy stock , hand , actually equity company question , case common stock , get voting right company operates . case , also get collect dividend , essentially share company 's profit . n't confuse interest payment dividend payment -- former , 're getting preset amount per contract , bond agreement , latter , 're benefiting company 've invested well.how choose corporate bond portfolioonce make decision invest corporate bond , 'll need make sure 're buying right one . 'll therefore need look following factor : term bondsthe price bondsthe credit rating bond ' issuerfirst , let 's talk term . longer 're willing lock money away , higher interest payment 'll generally receive . time , longer bond term come risk , 'll need weigh upside higher interest rate possibility getting use money however long bond come due . 're investing far-off goal , like retirement , bond 10-year term might good way go , especially interest rate higher 'd get five-year bond issuer . reason believe 'll need money sooner , 're better sticking shorter-term bonds.then 's price bond consider . stated , hard know whether 're getting fair price bond , general rule , wary 're charged price 's well face value . time , n't hesitate ask broker markup bond . good relationship broker , information easy enough come . time , n't hesitate comparison shop . 's specific bond mind , get quote different broker see 's competitive.finally , 's credit rating bond 's issuer consider . credit rating measure company 's ability make good obligation . higher rating , le likely issuer default obligation cause lose money.there three well-known rating agency rate bond issuer : standard & poor 's ( & p ) moody'sfitchs & p fitch use similar system rate bond issuer least risky follows : aaaaaabbbbbbccccccd ( refers bond already default ) moody 's rating system differs slightly , follows : aaaaaabaababcaacacfrom , number symbol used offer additional detail issuer 's creditworthiness . & p fitch use plus minus purpose , moody 's us number . example , b+ rating & p better b b- , ba1 moody 's higher rating ba2 ba3.as general rule , lower company 's credit rating , higher interest rate 'll snag buying bond .

're able point market strong , might make money -- least avoid losing money . sell bad time need free cash , could forced accept price face value , paid , thereby resulting loss.another downside associated corporate bond something called interest-rate risk . buy corporate bond , 're agreeing accept certain interest rate entire term bond . company issue bond later higher interest rate , bond automatically lose value 're stuck lower , earlier rate , new investor would rationally prefer buy bond company ( i.e. , risk default ) pay higher interest rate.for example , might buy 10-year , $ 20,000 bond paying % interest . company issue 10-year , $ 20,000 bond paying % interest six month bond 's term , bond value start sink , 're stuck scenario 're collecting lower rate years.another major issue buying corporate bond ? generally wo n't see anywhere close return 'd get stock . time , could affect ability accumulate wealth.between , stock averaged 11.3 % return , bond averaged 5.28 % .
