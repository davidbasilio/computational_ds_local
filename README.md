# Project Computational Data Science

## Scraping the data
Starting of from the start of the project, the first thing to do is run scraper_selection.py this will select which
files to scrape from the ones that much more data than cnn. So it breaks it down. This is already done and the correct
files are then added to data/source with an appended column "selected" with a value of 1.

Running the scraper will create a file in data/output called xxx_year_output.csv
This is the file that contains the data that is used in the analysis and is based in the files from data/source.
There are 3 scraper files, reuters, cnn, and fox. Each is individual and needs to be run for every file.
